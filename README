meta-openssl102-fips
====================

This layer provides a reference implementation of OpenSSL with the OpenSSL
FIPS Object Module.  The user is responsible for precompiling the necessary
openssl-fips binary objects using the steps described in the 
recipes-connectivity/openssl/openssl-fips/README file.

The items must be constructed according to the requirements of the security
policy and associated user guide.  See:

    https://www.openssl.org/docs/fips/SecurityPolicy-2.0.16.pdf
    https://www.openssl.org/docs/fips/UserGuide-2.0.pdf

Additionally you must provide your own copy of
    openssl-fips-2.0.16.tar.gz

This file must be acquired following the steps listed in section 4.1 of
the UserGuide-2.0.pdf.  See both section 4.1 and section 6.6 for more 
information on the "trusted path" and "secure installation" requirements.

See README.build for information on building the components, and making them
available for re-use.
